# textmate-django.tmbundle

Combination bundle for Django's Python and HTML grammars.

## Grammars
The existing Django support bundles frustrate me.  Hopefully this one does a better job staying current and providing utility instead of stumbling blocks.

### Python (Django)
Provides highlights for Django modules, classnames, and common method access.

### HTML (Django)
Provides through syntax highlighting for variables, filters, and blocks (built-in and custom).


## TBD
